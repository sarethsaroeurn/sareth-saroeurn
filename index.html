                <h3 style="color: white;">Ready to build a website + Job Market</h3>
                <p>There are already a number of nice tutorials on how to create an 
                    academic website, but most focus on established academics. There are 
                    also a number of paid-for options that work nicely. This tutorial is 
                    designed for new job candidates that want to create a simple job market
                     website using entirely free tools. We will use freely available software
                      R, Hugo, and Netlify. You can check out a preview of the website we will make here.</p>

            <p>Raphic design uses visual compositions 
                to solve problems and communicate ideas 
                through typography, imagery, color and form. 
                There’s no one way to do that, and that’s
                 why there are several types of graphic design,
                  each with their own area of specialization.
                  Though they often overlap, each type of graphic 
                  design requires specific set of skills and design
                   techniques. Many designers specialize in a single
                    type; others focus on a set of related, similar
                     types. But because the industry is constantly 
                     changing, designers must be adaptable and lifelong
                     learners so they can change or add specializations
                      throughout their careers.  </p>
