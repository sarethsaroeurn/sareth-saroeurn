            <h3>HTML for Absolute Beginners</h3> 
            <br>
                <p">While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML 
                using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will 
                instead focus on giving you the practical skills to build
                your first site.
                The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page 
                without spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the “why.”
                By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create
                a basic website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve
                further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.</p>
                <br>
            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to
                 begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.
                HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is 
                used to create pages and make them functional.
                The code used to make them visually appealing is known as
                 CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, 
                 we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</p>

            <h3>What Is the Job Market?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The job market is the market in which employers search for 
                employees and employees search for jobs. The job market is 
                not a physical place as much as a concept demonstrating the 
                competition and interplay between different labor forces. It is also known as the
            </p>
            <p>The job market can grow or shrink depending on the demand for labor
                 and the available supply of workers within the overall economy. </p>
                 <br>

            <h3>The Job Market and the Unemployment Rate</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The national unemployment rate is defined as the
                 percentage of unemployed workers in the total 
                 labor force. It is widely recognized as a key 
                 indicator of the performance of a country's labor 
                 market. As a closely watched economic indicator, the 
                 unemployment rate attracts a lot of media attention, 
                 especially during recessions and challenging economic 
                 times.</p>
