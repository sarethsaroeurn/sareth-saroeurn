            <p> Many employing graphic design skills work in a communications and marketing role. Technically, graphic design is visual communication. The American Institute of Graphic Arts today defines the field for current and aspiring graphic designers.
                The field formally incorporates creative and function understanding of seven elements into its own form of communication: space, texture, color, line, size, form, and shape.
                While many in graphic design do complete a college degree, it is not required. You will, however, need to demonstrate your graphic design skills beyond what is listed in your resume.
